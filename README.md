Music Player and Trainer

This website is a collection of musical tools that aims to create a playground where students can develop both interest and a further understanding of music theory. I notice that in music training, playing—or replicating—music is prioritized over creating music. But, there is just as much beauty in the creation of music. So, through this project, I hope to inspire musicians of all backgrounds and levels to view music not just as performance but also as an art form to create in.

This site is split into two sections: play and train. The "Play" section is intended to foster interest with tools like a virtual, drums, and a chord player. These tools allow students to take their first step in music creation. Then, the "Train" section contains tools that aims to practice students' pitch sensitivity, scale memorization, and keyboard familiarity—all crucial skills in music theory that allows students to create music.

These tools rely heavily on Tone.js to create interactive sounds that mimics piano keys, chords, and drums. Other tools include ml5.js, which is a machine learning library that I used to create a real-time tuner. Then, these tools are packaged in modal windows/iframe to be present in an organized way.

Because the purpose of this website is to foster a feeling of play that invites experimentation, the css is also designed accordingly with fun wave-text animations, interactive 3D-tilt effects, and floating background bubbles. Inspired by sound waves, the site also includes spectrum bars and dynamic waveform graphics.
